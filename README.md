# Gesture Cursor Control

A Python-based hand tracking project that allows you to control your mouse cursor using hand gestures detected from your webcam.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time hand tracking using [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe).
- Cursor movement controlled by your index finger.
- Click action triggered by pinching (bringing index and middle fingers close together).
- Smooth and natural cursor movement.
- Works with a single hand.

## 🛠️Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanishqSinghAnand/gesture-cursor-control.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

## 🚀Usage

## ✋How to use

- To click, bring your index and middle fingers close together inside the rectangle.
